Here's the recipe for Homemade Dinner Rolls:\n\n## Homemade Dinner Rolls Recipe:\n\n**Ingredients:**\n\n* 2 1/4 teaspoons active dry yeast (1 packet)\n* 1/4 cup warm water (105°F to 115°F)\n* 1/4 cup granulated sugar\n* 1 cup warm milk (105°F to 115°F)\n* 1 large egg\n* 1/4 cup melted butter, cooled slightly\n* 1 teaspoon salt\n* 3 1/2 to 4 cups all-purpose flour\n\n**Instructions:**\n\n1. **Activate the Yeast:** In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let stand for about 5 minutes until foamy, indicating that the yeast is alive and active. \n\n2. **Combine Wet Ingredients:** In a large bowl, whisk together the warm milk, egg, melted butter, and salt. Add the yeast mixture and whisk until combined.\n\n3. **Add Flour:** Gradually add the flour, one cup at a time, mixing well after each addition. Once the dough starts to come together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes until smooth and elastic. Add more flour as needed if the dough is too sticky.\n\n4. **First Rise:** Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover it with a damp cloth or plastic wrap, and let it rise in a warm place for about 1 hour or until doubled in size.\n\n5. **Shape Rolls:** Punch down the dough and divide it into equal portions (about 12-15 pieces). Shape each portion into a smooth ball and place them in a greased baking pan, leaving some space between them for rising.\n\n6. **Second Rise:** Cover the pan loosely and let the rolls rise for another 30-45 minutes until puffy.\n\n7. **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).\n\n8. **Bake:** Bake the rolls for 15-20 minutes or until golden brown.\n\n9. **Serve:** Brush the tops with melted butter (optional) and serve warm. Enjoy!"]
